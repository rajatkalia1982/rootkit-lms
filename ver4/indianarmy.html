<h1>How to Join Indian Army as an Officer</h1>
<br>
<p>
There are a number of ways in which one could get a commission in the Army. You can join right after school or after graduation. The selection procedures are impartial, objective and are uniformly applied to one and all and have only one aim – to “select the best”.​TYPES OF COMMISSION​The Army offers both permanent and short service commission. Permanent commission (PC) is granted through the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehradun and Short Service Commission (SSC) is granted through Officers Training Academy (OTA) Chennai. When you opt for ‘PC’, you are basically looking at a permanent career in the Army, a career till you retire. SSC is a wonderful option for all those of you who aspire to serve it for a few years. It gives you the option of joining the Army, and serving it as a commissioned officer for ten years. Once your tenure is over, you are allowed to opt for PC. Alternatively, you can also ask for a four years extension and can choose to resign from your post any time during this period.​
